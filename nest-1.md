# Introduction & Getting Started

## CLI and Project

Firstly, We install nestjs in our machine

```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Navigate to work directory and run the following

> nest new <project_name>

```
nest new myapp
```

---

## Actions

- We installed nestjs cli globally
- We used that CLI to make a new project

## Result

- In terminal, there is success message of new project creation

## Now?

- Go inside the new project `cd myapp`
- Open VS Code `code .`
